<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">
<b>Lack of Awareness & Access to Healthcare Schemes</b><br/>
• State and Central governments have provided 15+ schemes for reducing healthcare costs/burden.<br/>
• As of 2017–2018, only 14.1% of the rural population had health insurance coverage.<br/>
• Lack of awareness of schemes, applicability, and application process is the major hurdle in using these benefits.
</p>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">
<b>Infrastructure Gaps</b><br/>
• Doctor-patient or Patient-Receptionist ratio of ~1:1456 and ~1:25,000 in rural areas.
</p>

<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;">
<b>Receptionist Quality & Quantity Crisis</b><br/>
• Many hospitals lack sufficient trained receptionists, especially during peak hours.<br/>
• The few available receptionists are often untrained or unable to handle the high volume of patients.<br/>
• This results in:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– No one explaining government scheme benefits to the patients<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Confusion and chaos at registration desks<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;– Increased wait times and patient dissatisfaction<br/>
• Ultimately, patients are not getting the facilities they are entitled to — not because they don’t exist, but because the front desk fails to deliver them.
